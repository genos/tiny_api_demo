This tiny demonstration serves HTML to a web browser and JSON over a REST endpoint, using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) microframework to handle the details. You can read more about this [on my blog](https://grahamenos.com/tiny-api-demo.html).

## Do not use this!

As the blog post says,

> This whole thing cuts so many corners it might as well be a sphere.
> It's _certainly_ not a production-ready example by _any_ stretch of the imagination; it's only enough for demonstration purposes.
